# tiny-rust-binaries: Tiny amd64 ELF executables using nightly Rust

This shows a way to create executables of minimal binary size for various
toy programs (Hello World, Guess the number, byte statistics for a file)
using Rust. Various techniques are employed to get the executable size this small:

- Not using the Rust standard library, only Rust core.
Interaction with the system happens by syscalls from assembly code
(see `src/calls.asm`).
- Using codegen options `lto, opt-level=z`.
- A linker script that discards unnecessary sections and packs all code
into one executable segment. This segment is aligned to be compatible
with the next step, which is the reason why the binaries generated by the
Rust compiler (in `target/self/release`) will segfault when trying to
directly execute them.
- A minifier program that extracts the code segment from the ELF file
generated by the Rust compiler and puts it into a minimal ELF file with
just one program header and no section headers (only 120 bytes of header
overhead).

Size of the generated executables (on my system):

| Program       | Size (bytes) |
| ------------- |:------------:|
| hello         | 239          |
| guess         | 1068         |
| bytes         | 1176         |

In my testing, the size of the generated Rust executables was found to be
about 20% larger than that of equivalent programs written in C
and compiled using the same process.

## Prerequisites

- amd64 system running Linux
- nightly Rust toolchain
- cargo-xbuild
- nasm

## How to build

Just run `./build.sh`, the binaries are then found in the binaries/ directory.

For the `bytes` program, you need to give a file as input to get statistics.
You could run it on its own binary file: `binaries/bytes < binaries/bytes`.
